Blackjack Game in Java

Project Description

This is a beginner-friendly implementation of the classic card game Blackjack developed in Java. The game serves as a practical exercise for learning and applying the basics of Java programming, including object-oriented programming concepts.

The project demonstrates the use of:
	•	Loops
	•	Conditional Statements (if-else)
	•	ArrayLists
	•	Functions
	•	Classes and Objects
	•	Inheritance and Abstraction
	•	Function Overloading and Overriding

 How to Play

The game follows the traditional rules of Blackjack:
	1.	The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
	2.	Players are dealt two cards initially, and they can choose to:
	•	Hit: Draw another card.
	•	Stand: Stop drawing cards and keep their current total.
	3.	The dealer plays according to predefined rules (e.g., must hit on a total of 16 or less).
	4.	The game compares the player’s and dealer’s totals to determine the winner.

 Features
	•	Basic Gameplay: Simulates a single-player game against the computer.
	•	Card Deck Management: Uses an ArrayList to represent and shuffle the deck.
	•	Player Actions: Allows the player to hit or stand.
	•	OOP Design:
	•	Classes represent entities like Card, Deck, Player, and Dealer.
	•	Inheritance and abstraction are used to enhance code reusability.
	•	Function overloading and overriding demonstrate method flexibility.

 Key Concepts Demonstrated
	1.	Object-Oriented Programming:
	•	Encapsulation through private fields and public methods.
	•	Inheritance for shared behavior between Player and Dealer.
	•	Polymorphism via method overloading and overriding.
	2.	Collections:
	•	Use of ArrayList to handle dynamic card storage and deck operations.
	3.	Control Flow:
	•	Loops (while, for) for game logic.
	•	Conditional statements (if-else) for decision-making.

 Future Improvements
	•	Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
	•	Support multiplayer functionality.
	•	Implement additional game rules (e.g., splitting pairs, insurance bets).
	•	Enhance dealer AI for more realistic gameplay.
